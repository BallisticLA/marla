function[V, lambda_matrix] = evd2(A, k, s, p)
%{
    Once we have Omega, we construct Q = A * Omega and return Cholesky decomposition of 
    Omega' * Q. This function is agnostic to the implementation of the
    sketching: it might has different ways of row sketching. We make no
    assumptions on the RowSketcher's termination criteria beyond those
    listed below.
    Return the eigen decomposition matrices (V, lambda_matrix),
    based on a row sketched version of A.
    Use a Gaussian sketching matrix and pass over A a total of
    num_passes times.
    Parameters
    ----------
    A : matrix
        Data matrix to approximate. A must be an n Ã— n Hermitian matrix.
    k : int
        Target rank for the approximation of A: 0 < k < min(size(A)).
        This parameter includes any oversampling. For example, if you
        want to be near the optimal (Eckhart-Young) error for a rank 20
        approximation of A, then you might want to set k=25.
    s  : int
        Auxiliary parameter for the QBDecomposer or RangeFinder.
    p : int
        Number of power iterations used. Using this algorithm version
        implies increase of the number of passes over matrix A by 2 with each
        power iteration. 

    Returns
    -------
    V : matrix
        Has size (size(A, 1), k). Columns are orthonormal.
    lambda_matrix : matrix
        Has size (k,k). lambda_matrix is a diagonal matrix storing the eigenvalues of 
        the matrix A.
