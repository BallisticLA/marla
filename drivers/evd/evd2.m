function[V, lambda_matrix] = evd2(A, k, over, num_passes)
%
%     Return a matrix V and column vector lambda that define a positive 
%     semidefinite matrix "A_approx" through its eigen-decomposition:
% 
%         A_approx = V * diag(lambda) * V'.
% 
%     The function assumes A is symmetric positive semidefinite.
%     The columns of V are approximations of the dominant eigenvectors of A.
%     The entries of lambda are the corresponding approximate eigenvalues.
% 
%     The approximation is "fixed rank." The matrix V has d = min(k, rank(A))
%     columns, and there is no direct control over the approximation error
%     ||A_approx - A||. Increasing "num_passes" and "over" should result in
%     better approximations.
% 
%     Parameters
%     ----------
%     A : matrix
%         Data matrix to approximate. A must be an n Ã— n Hermitian matrix.
% 
%     k : int
%         Target rank for the approximation of A: 0 < k < min(size(A)).
%         This parameter includes any oversampling. For example, if you
%         want to be near the optimal (Eckhart-Young) error for a rank 20
%         approximation of A, then you might want to set k=25.
% 
%     over : int
%         Perform internal calculations with a sketch of rank (k + over).
%         This is usually a small constant, e.g., 5 to 25. In some situations
%         it's useful to set over = k.
% 
%     num_passes : int
%         Total number of passes the algorithm is allowed over A.
%         We require num_passes >= 2, and usually we have num_passes <= 10.
%         Increasing this parameter is one way to obtain better
%         approximations, especially at lower ranks.
% 
%     Returns
%     -------
%     V : matrix
%         Has size (n, d), where d = min(k, rank(A)).
%         Columns are orthonormal.
% 
%     lambda : vector
%         Has size (d, 1), where d = min(k, rank(A)).
