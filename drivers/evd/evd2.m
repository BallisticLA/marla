function[V, lambda, log] = evd2(A, k, over, num_passes, s, logging)
%{
     Return a matrix V and column vector lambda that define a positive 
     semidefinite matrix "A_approx" through its eigen-decomposition:
 
         A_approx = V * diag(lambda) * V'.
 
     The function assumes A is symmetric positive semidefinite.
     The columns of V are approximations of the dominant eigenvectors of A.
     The entries of lambda are the corresponding approximate eigenvalues.
 
     The approximation is "fixed rank." The matrix V has d = min(k, rank(A))
     columns, and there is no direct control over the approximation error
     ||A_approx - A||. Increasing "num_passes" and "over" should result in
     better approximations.
 
     Parameters
     ----------
     A : matrix
         Data matrix to approximate. A must be an n Ã— n Hermitian matrix.
 
     k : int
         Target rank for the approximation of A: 0 < k < min(size(A)).
         This parameter includes any oversampling. For example, if you
         want to be near the optimal (Eckhart-Young) error for a rank 20
         approximation of A, then you might want to set k=25.
 
     over : int
         Perform internal calculations with a sketch of rank (k + over).
         This is usually a small constant, e.g., 5 to 25. In some situations
         it's useful to set over = k.
 
     num_passes : int
         Total number of passes the algorithm is allowed over A.
         We require num_passes >= 2, and usually we have num_passes <= 10.
         Increasing this parameter is one way to obtain better
         approximations, especially at lower ranks.

     logging : struct array 
         Parameter for logging different levels of detailed information.
         Contains two fields:
         Depth - describes on how many subroutines levels should the info
         be logged (0 for none, 1 for just the main routine, etc).
         Span - describes which types of info should be logged (0 for none,
         1 for timings, 2 for timings + errors estimates, 3 for unusual 
         behaviors).
 
     Returns
     -------
     V : matrix
         Has size (n, d), where d = min(k, rank(A)).
         Columns are orthonormal.
 
     lambda : vector
         Has size (d, 1), where d = min(k, rank(A)).

     log : structure array
         Holds fields with logged information on routine - fields depend on
         subroutines used.
